# Frontend-Nanodegree-Feedreader

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

## What I did :

- "RSS Feeds" : Ensure 'allFeeds' are defined & it's not empty. also check the 'URL' and 'Name' is defined
- "The Menu" : just to make sure 'menu' element is hidden by default
- "menu display" : I made a click on the 'menu-icon-link' to open the menu and test it with 'hasClass' & I've made a click on the 'menu-icon-link' to close the menu and test it with 'hasClass'
- "Initial Entries" :  made a new variable & ensures 'loadFeed' function is called and completes its work & check if 'feedId' is greater than 0
- "New Feed Selection" : Ensures a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes
- "feed content changes" : test comparing
