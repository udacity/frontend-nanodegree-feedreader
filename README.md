# Project Overview

Since JavaScipt does not have a testing functionality, this project uses Jasmine library to write the test case suites to check if the parts of our project are woking as we expect them to work.


## Steps Required

- Clone or Download the file
- 7 test cases have been defined to check their functionality
- open index.html to see the page along with the tests
- 'describe' statements are indicated by black color whereas the 'it' statements in green color
- make changes in the app.js file to ensure that the tests have been properly written
